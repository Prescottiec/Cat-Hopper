# Cat-Hopper

## Background
Cat Hopper is a simple and classic looking game where the runner, a cat, jumps over obstacles in a setting of a town. As time passes in the game, the faster the cat will run making it more and more challenging. There is only one rule: don't run into any obstacles. If the cat hits an obstacle, then the game will start over and if the user has a highscore then they would be put onto the score board. 

## Functionality & MVP
In the Cat-Hopper game, users will be able to:
* Start, pause, and reset the game
* Jump over obstacles to stay alive
* See their score
* Get onto the highscore board

In addition, this project will include: 
* A production read me
* A scoreboard on the side of the game canvas

## Wireframes
The page will be a simple layout with the game board, nav links, main title, and scoreboard. This webapp will consist of a single screen with a game board and nav links to my Github and LinkedIn. The scoreboard will include the highscores in descending order. 

## Architecture and Technologies
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
* `Javascript` for game logic,
